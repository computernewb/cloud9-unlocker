# cloud9-unlocker
In Cloud9, you may have noticed that you cannot sudo apt install a lot of software. This is because Cloud9, by default, adds a repostiory list which contains a very limited amount of software.

This bash script will remove those sources and replace them with the default Ubuntu 14.04.3 repositories.
